                          <div style="color:orange; font-size:25px;">&nbsp; <strong>Human Elements</strong></div>


          <p>The human elements of a community are by far one of the more important aspects of community development. Communities are based upon the people that make up their memberships; without \
them, communities wouldn't exist. It's no wonder then that factors related to the people can be so influential on community development. The diversity in human populations largely contributes to t\
his, and many of these factors are rooted in the human nature of community members. Some human factors include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:yellow;font-size:18px;">Participation-</strong>Participation is something that is repeatedly brought up in regards to community development because\
 it really does play a significant role in the process. The human element of community means that participation is practically mandatory on some level in community development. However, this does \
not mean that participation should be forced upon the community and its members; such paternalistic actions can backfire and are damaging to the process's results.<sup>1 </sup>Quite possibly, forc\
ed participation can lead to resentment and sabotage regarding the efforts being made.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:white; font-size:18px;">Interest-</strong>To put it plainly, the success of a community development plan is going to hinge on how much people care \
about their community. When there is considerable interest, community members are going to willing put the work in for improvements. Little to no interest means it's unlikely that anything will ge\
t accomplished any time soon.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:red; font-size:18px;">Leadership-</strong>It's the leadership that guides the community through things. The actions of a community's leader and t\
heir abilities are going to determine the outcome of the community development process. Poor or ineffective leadership, especially when there's a lack of communication, can be especially devastati\
ng and can destroy trust and credibility with community members.<sup>2 </sup>Strong, positive leadership, on the other hand, can bring the community together and set them on the path towards succe\
ss in their efforts to improve themselves.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:orange;">Attitude-</strong>Just because community members willing participate and have a genuine interest in community development d\
oesn't mean that their attitude will match. People do things that they don't necessarily like all the time, usually out of necessity, duty, morality, or other influence. Attitudes can impact the e\
ffectiveness of the efforts made in community development, and can be especially influential when there are conflicting attitudes involved.</li>

            </li>
				     
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:#33D4FF;font-size:18px;">Legal Restrictions-</strong>Laws are in place for a reason, but that doesn't mean that they are not problematic for develop\
ment. In most cases, legal restrictions on community development are there to prevent an overstepping of boundaries and to ensure that social rules are followed. Any legal restrictions that are in\
 place in a community will often help development leaders determine what changes and efforts are going to be feasible and beneficial to the community.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Government Involvement-C</strong>ommunity development does include some government involvement. This can vary based on exis\
ting laws and what it is that you are trying to accomplish with the process. Large-scale actions may require more government involvement than smaller actions. Event or building permits, for exampl\
e, usually need approval from local government agencies in order to obtain them. Government involvement may pose some restrictions on the community development process, but it can also act as a gu\
iding force.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:#8033FF;font-size:18px;">Economics-</strong>The local economic factors are going to impact quite a bit when it comes to community development. Anyth\
ing from community members' socioeconomic status to available resources, to their willingness to participate in the process can be tied to the economy.<sup>8</sup> Poverty is one of the most commo\
n issues that community development is used to improve. Economies that are heavily impacted by poverty are often the ones that need community development the most, but their instability make it th\
at much harder for the process to work.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:orange;font-size:18px;">Natural Disasters-</strong>Certain community development efforts are going to be centered on what goes on in the community'\
s environment. This includes things like climate and weather. Geography plays a heavy role in how natural disasters like tornadoes and earthquakes impact communities, but not all community develop\
ment efforts take such things into consideration. Depending on a community's location, many of the issues the process is setting out to address may be a byproduct of the damage caused by natural d\
isasters common to those areas.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:#FE00DB;font-size:18px;">Impediments-</strong>Location-based obstacles, like geographic structures, can influence what community development efforts\
 are needed and what will work. An island-based community is going to have different geographic impediments than a community that is inland. Such features can impact the availability of resources,\
 and what elements of culture, social expectations, and belief systems are present in the community. These can be harder obstacles to face due to the fact that you cannot always remove or replace \
them through conventional means, if at all.
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">&nbsp; <strong>Resources</strong></p>
            </li>
      
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:#FF335E;font-size:18px;">Availability-</strong>It's really difficult to accomplish anything in community development when the availability of your n\
ecessary resources is limited. This is applicable for financial, material, human, or social resources, as areas that are lacking tend to put added strain elsewhere.<sup>10 </sup>Many community lea\
ders will shape their community development efforts around the resources they already have access to, which can cut down on any availability issues that can arise later on in the process. However,\
 a lack of resources isn't the only way that the process can be impacted; an abundance of resources can be an issue because it can lead to waste.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong style="color:#E52828;font-size:18px;" >Sustainability-</strong>The sustainability of the resources used by the community during the community development process \
can carry a lot of influence over other factors. Unsustainable resources can have damaging effects on the community's environment and can drain other necessary resources in their handling and acqu\
irement. They also tend to have limited usage-mostly once and then that's it. Sustainable resources, on the other hand, can often be used repeatedly before being discarded and they have a lower en\
vironmental impact. In some cases, such resources can be introduced to the community and flourish on their own for later usage. Depending on what it is that the community wants to accomplish, addr\
essing the sustainability of their resources may be necessary.</li>
